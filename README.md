# Project-0 
This project has three pages that include the main search page (index.html) an AdvancedSearch page and an ImageSearch page. This project was created with the intention to mimic the functionality of Google search.
My task with this project was to expand on this site, creating your own front end for Google Search, as by exploring Googleâ€™s interface to identify what GET parameters it expects and adding the necessary HTML and CSS to your website.
